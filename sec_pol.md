# Xtract Security, Privacy, Computer and Network Policy {#top}

Xtract Solutions is a software provider to the healthcare market and as such our responsibility of securing our clients' and their patients' data is of paramount importance. The following policy outlines Xtract's responsibilities and practices when executing our service to clients, which at times causes us to access and handle confidential health information.

This policy is designed to reflect the requirements of *The Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act 1996* (HIPAA). Xtract is a technology provider to the healthcare industry and thereby a *Business Associate of Covered Entities* (HIPAA terms for vendors who support operations for organizations who actually engage directly with patients), which requires us to meet certain organizational security and process requirements.

Please note that this is an educational document intended to train Xtract employees on our operational obligations, not a statement of legal requirements, and is in no way comprehensive toward that end. All employees should have acute awareness of the aspects of this policy that affect their role at Xtract. Xtract believes in the value of training and a "Culture of Compliance", whereby we take mutual responsibility and share accountability to not just follow these requirements, but believe in them, and exceed them wherever possible.

# Xtract General Privacy and Security Policy {#privacy-security}

## Operational Responsibilities

Every member of the Xtract team is subject to and/or responsible for the operational practices as they relate to their tasks at Xtract. Per our Mission and Values, Xtract places patient care as the pinnacle of our service. As such, protecting patient data and PHI is a pinnacle element in our actions, operations, and culture. Abiding by these requirements helps ensure that Xtract is never a vector which exposes our client's Protected Health Information (PHI) to unauthorized view or use.

The following duties and responsibilities are required for every staff member, contractor, or business collaborator:

### Company Standards

- Xtract regards all clients' patient and user information as 'Personal Information' and commits to keeping this information confidential. This includes:
  - Name, address, sex, Race, health information, and user credentials
  - Other data not specifically called out which Xtract gathers may be considered PI, care should be taken with any data and it should be treated as possible PI
- As a Business Associate of health care providers, Xtract is responsible to both appropriately use, and to secure all data at rest and in transit
  - Inappropriate use includes: accessing, using, taking, possessing, releasing, editing, and destroying without authorization, need, or justification
- Annual HIPAA and Privacy training will ensure staff members are aware of privacy and security responsibilities with PHI
  - Dir of Ops will ensure all staff meet annual training requirements
  - Training will be based on [Xtract Operational Policy and Privacy Training](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NKFKoePnuaypypB8NLrVH9xUDk762JIhA-BT10VQDes/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Assessments will be recorded through an email to the Director of Operations
- Employees failing to comply with any requirements of the security and HIPAA policies herein will escalate through the process below. Severity may vary based on disclosure risk or result
  - Verbal warning
  - Written warning
  - Employee Improvement Plan
  - Successive negligent behavior with regard to security and PHI may result in termination of employment

### Use and Access to ePHI / PHI

- HIPAA is specific about a 'minimum necessary' rule. Xtract staff will only have access to PHI only as needed to perform their role, and will access the minimum necessary
  - Wherever possible, when using client data for development or scoping, anonymize data before moving from a client site to any other system
- Xtract doesn't release PHI to anyone outside of the customer who owns and generates the PHI. The general guidance of HIPAA for Release of Information is therefore limited to the Patient/Covered Entity Relationship. NEVER release ANY PHI to anyone outside of the organization who generated the data
- NEVER place PHI onto any personal devices (laptops, phones, computers, media devices, etc)

## Management Responsibilities

Management roles at Xtract have specific responsibilities to ensure that these policies meet our legal and ethical requirements, and ensure organizational HIPAA compliance.

### Security and HIPAA Roles

Xtracts policy calls out specific roles as additional duties for staff members to fulfill the requirements of HIPAA. Roles are assigned and reviewed annually by the CEO or whenever staffing changes require. The roles at Xtract are:

- **Security Officer**
  - Responsible for managing and maintaining these policies and any evolving legislation which may govern them. Responsible for ensuring the organization follows the procedures and meets all ethical and legal requirements, and manages and disciplinary actions needed where lapses are found
    - Security Officer (with support of Director of Operations and Director of IT) will conduct an annual Security Risk Assessment (SRA) and ensure any unacceptable risks are resolved
    - Security Officer will review and adapt these procedures and policies to evolving regulations and business operations. These changes will be documented and retrained for a minimum of 6 years. Revision history will be tracked through a revision table at the end of this policy document, or in GitHub via the company Policy Portal
    - Monitor Alarms - AAAC Link in roles and roster
    - Events posing risk to PHI will be investigated directly by the Security Officer with a written plan including:
      - Summary of the Event
      - Investigation findings
      - Corrective Actions and Resolutions
- **Director of Operations** 
  - Responsible for managing team roster and roles, ensuring staff abide by training requirements, and ensuring client contracts and BAA align with these policies and procedures
- **Director of IT**
  - Responsible for managing the operational network and Xtract terminals/servers to ensure they meet the nature of requirements of this policy and procedure, and additionally any legal and ethical requirements of HIPAA

### Breach Management

Assumed or actual breaches require rigorous investigation and management with legal outcomes based on the circumstances and severity. A breach is defined as "an impermissible use or disclosure that compromises the security or privacy of PHI".

Any time a staff member suspects PHI was used or disclosed outside the appropriate use and access of HIPAA, it should be reported immediately to the Security Officer. In the event that a breach is assumed or actual, the following process will take place and be documented: 

- Reported impermissible use or disclosure
- An investigation
- A Security Risk Assessment (SRA) containing at least 
  - The nature and extent of PHI involved, including the type of identifier and the likelihood of re-identifications (e.g. Social Security Number and mental health diagnosis pairing has a higher severity than a Medical Record Number and date of last allergy shot pairing)
  - The unauthorized person who used the PHI or to whom the disclosure was made
  - Whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed
  - The extent to which the risk to the PHI has been mitigated

Events that do not classify a breach:

- Unintentional access by a staff member, made in good faith and within the scope of authority of the employee
- Inadvertent disclosure between employees of similar authority with otherwise legitimate access to the information
- If Xtract has a good faith belief that the recipient of the impermissible disclosure does not have the ability to retain the information

### Notification Process

Notification is required if exposed PHI has not been rendered unusable, unreadable or indecipherable to unauthorized persons.

If a breach is identified which Xtract has reason to believe is un-encrypted and accessible to unauthorized individuals the following notification process applies:

- Notify the Covered Entity
  - Covered entities have a host of additional requirements (eg. Notifying the individual affected, Notify the Secretary, and sometimes provide a Media Notice)
- Xtract will participate actively with the related covered entity(s) affected by a breach of PHI Xtract is responsible for
	
# Access Control Policy {#access-control}

In accordance with HIPAA and the principle of minimum necessary exposure to PHI, the following policy outlines how access to operational tools is granted, managed, and rescinded.

References: 
- [Xtract Roster and Roles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NY4rkYO1yUoS7Y0MZ5a73kj7p04lu3xSQD0YY2KbjBw/edit?usp=sharing) (managed by Director of Operations)
- Internal System Access
  - Relevant operational systems are configured with privilege levels and granted at the discretions of the Director of Operations or staff directors
  - A list of these apps is in the Roster Document
- Client System Access
  - The operations team has access instructions to client sites through the current tools outlined in the [Support Tools and Procedures](https://xtractsolutions.github.io/orientation/Support-Tools-and-Procedures) repository
  - All operation team members are responsible for managing and keeping Passwords and credentials up to date and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enabled
  - Password access privilege is managed by Xtract Director of Operations

## Termination Process

At time of termination, the Director of Operations coordinates an effort to simultaneously release the employee or contractor and rescind all access privileges, which includes at a minimum:

- Keeper, GitHub, Podio, Gmail, Drive, physical computer access, physical facility access, and any other relevant access is rescinded immediately. (Check [Support Tools and Procedures](https://xtractsolutions.github.io/orientation/Support-Tools-and-Procedures) for list of active system tools)
- There are no privileges to keep files or emails from company systems, though certain releases may be granted upon request and after review by the Director of Operations or Security Officer to ensure there is no PHI included.
- Clients granting personal remote access to Xtract employees are notified of termination and requested to rescind access.



# Employee Computer & Use Policy {#computer-use}

Computer access is at the core of Xtract operations. Employees are given work computers to fulfill work duties. These guidelines outline how those computers are managed and appropriate use guidelines for all staff members. The requirements of this policy are to be managed by the Director of IT or their designee.

- [Xtract Computer Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13pigmum57HClwlBX6pEc0mAu2YumXvWTLzRcSR8Ta9U/edit?usp=sharing)

## Employee Computer Practices

- All computers used for Xtract work will be locked when not in use for any period of time
- Shared computers (servers, kiosks, QA, and test machines) must not include PHI whenever possible
- Passwords for Xtract and customer Systems which can be used to access PHI can only be kept in the Xtract Managed Keeper account(s)
- Passwords to staff terminals should not be shared, and if sharing is required in an emergency they should be changed as soon as possible
- Windows Defender or similar Antivirus must remain enabled and up to date on all windows computers
- Never click links in suspicious emails or even unsolicited messages 

## Interaction with Client Databases and PHI

- PHI from clients is only to be used in transient states. If PHI is pulled to Xtract machines, it should be purged as soon as it's useful life is complete
- When using a client database which may include PHI, use the `php artisan db:anonomize` command as soon as possible
- Do not send patient PHI in emails to clients
  - Sending PHI by email exposes the PHI to two risks:
    - The email could be sent to the wrong person
    - The email could be captured electronically en route
  - HIPAA requires that we take reasonable steps to protect against these risks but acknowledges that a balance must be struck between the need to secure PHI and the need to ensure that clinicians can efficiently exchange important patient care information
    - If a client sends an email containing PHI, instruct them on using just the Xtract-generated `patient_id` (located in the patient header) going forward
- Whenever possible, write down any needed patient information and shred the paper as soon as possible

## Xtract Data Security Posture

This is a subsection of the Computer and Use Policy outlining the actual tools used. These are designated and managed by the Director of IT

- [Guidance is available here](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/guidance/index.html) for rendering PHI Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Users. Data breached when following those guidelines is considered under 'safe harbor'
- Windows machines are configured for automated updates and staff is instructed to accept them
- Terminals are configured to autolock after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Antivirus:** Xtract leverages Windows Defender or similar as our Antivirus and maintains it on all Terminals and Windows Servers
- **HDD Encryption:** Xtract Leverages Bit Locker as our at-rest encryption and maintains it on all windows machines 
- **VPN:** For secure remote access to the Xtract Network we leverage OpenVPN configured and managed by Director of IT
- **Firewall:** Xtract leverages PfSense as our firewall



# Xtract Physical Security Policy {#physical-security}

Per HIPAA, the physical office (and any of our work computers or workstations outside of the office) requires safeguards to ensure access to PHI is not compromised. These are:

- Team members are trained in lock-up procedures when granted a key, and team members with keyed access are documented in [Xtract Roster and Roles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NY4rkYO1yUoS7Y0MZ5a73kj7p04lu3xSQD0YY2KbjBw/edit?usp=sharing)
- Office is locked anytime it's unattended
- Monitored alarm is armed anytime the building is unattended
- Alarm notifications are managed by the Security Officer and will be investigated by the Security Officer or their designee
  - The phone tree rings to the CEO, then the President, then the Director of IT
- Visitors in the building should be monitored at all times by the invitee or their designee
- Any suspicious activity noted by any employee of a visitor or staff member should be immediately reported to the Security Officer (anonymity will be maintained where desired)



# Xtract Application Security Policy {#application-security}

The following standards and practices will be used in the development and release of Xtract software systems for use by clients. The [Xtract Development Standard Operating Procedure](https://xtractsolutions.github.io/dev-sop/) is intentionally designed to architect secure applications to the best of our collective knowledge and ability.

- The Director of Development ensures the Development and Release process is followed before any code is released to clients
- [Penetration Test leveraging tools](https://github.com/XtractSolutions/Gen2_XIS/issues/6257) are executed annually. The Director of Development is responsible for ensuring these occur, and that any unacceptable risks are mitigated in subsequent releases
- Any team member suspicious of a risk in code that could compromise the security of the system or pose a risk to patient care is not only empowered, but ethically obligated to notify the Director of Development, and/or the Security Officer and/or the Director of Operations immediately



# Xtract Security Risk Analysis Procedure {#risk-analysis}

Under HIPAA there are specific requirements for executing a Security Risk Assessment to identify potential risks to PHI and create plans to address them. These are:

- The system-wide SRA will be conducted using this tool
- The SRA will be reviewed and updated annually by the Security Officer
- Results will be stored in a report in Google Drive identified by the year



# Xtract Breach Policy and Procedure {#breach-policy}

- As per HIPAA, Xtract will fulfill responsibilities if a breach is ever suspected or identified
- Details of the procedure are in the [Xtract Risk Management and Disaster Response Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZB4SSXaeHwo2bTfTIX-579HHP3CaA1i58cEsbJpry40/edit?usp=sharing)



# Release of Information {#release-of-information}

Under HIPAA, there are specific requirements for the release of PHI. Given Xtract's role as a Business Associate (not a covered entity), there are no cases where PHI can be released. The following principles will season all communication regarding PHI:

- Only discuss PHI with the Client who generated the data
- As much as possible, refer to data in a de-identified format or using elements not linked to an identifiable patient (Xtract-generated `patient_id`)
- If clients have justifiable needs of custom reports, extreme diligence should be exhibited to ensure the data is returned only to the client who generated it
- NEVER DISCLOSE PHI TO ANY UNQUALIFIED ENTITY. Ever. There is no justifiable need
